# Introduction

A VHDL and Verilog Processor designed for academic purposes and future potential as a soft-core processor build for space

TODO:
* This project will explore open source tools and IP, and have tutorials, examples, videos, and testbenchs.
* This project will also explore different FPGA companies and devleopment boards.
* List of tools and IP to explore:
    * COCOTB
    * IVerilog
    * Chisel
    * GHDL
    * LiteX
    * Various Riscv processors (ex. VexRiscv)
    * Python/C based HLS Tools
    

STEPS:
* EDAplayground for a System Verilog test bench and DUT
* Have test bench use UVM
* Move test bnech and DUT to open source software COCOTB, IVerilog, and GHDL
* Compare options
