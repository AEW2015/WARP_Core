[Icarus Verilog]( http://iverilog.icarus.com/)

##What

Icarus Verilog or iVerlog is an open source simulator for the Verilog designs.  It does not support System Verilog.  It may have addons for VHDL as well.

##Why

I want to keep this project open source so anyone can use the software.

Another alternative is Xilinx Vivado with Webpack license(has System Verilog), but Cocotb doesn’t support this simulator yet.
