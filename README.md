# WARP_Core
Wilson AXI RISCV Processor Core

- [Website Documentation]( http://wilsoninspace.com/warp-core/) shows all the steps I went through in designing and testing this project.

## News

The Goal is design a working RISCV processor for the Artix-7 on the Arty Board

## Info

This Project is now focused on designing a RISCV processor to use the AXI bus.

Try to keep projects to minimal
- bd.tcl, verilog/vhdl

## Log

Moving away from designing my own processor from scratch

- [Docs](https://github.com/AEW2015/WARP_Core/tree/master/Docs) is for parts documentation and reference material
- [Projects](https://github.com/AEW2015/WARP_Core/tree/master/Projects) will contain the top level HDL for test and fun applications.
- [Cores](https://github.com/AEW2015/WARP_Core/tree/master/Cores) will hold all the completed cores. 


This project is continuing from the Mimas V2 processor
